== Abstract ==

'''MemoTrie''' is functional library for creating efficient memo functions, using [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie trie]s.  It's based on some code I got from Spencer Janssen and uses type families.

Besides this wiki page, here are more ways to find out about MemoTrie:
* Read [http://code.haskell.org/MemoTrie/doc/html/ the library documentation].
* Get the code repository: '''<tt>darcs get http://code.haskell.org/MemoTrie</tt>'''.
* Install from [http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/MemoTrie Hackage].
* See the [[MemoTrie/Versions| version history]].

Please leave comments at the [[Talk:MemoTrie|Talk page]].
